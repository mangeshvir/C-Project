# CPP-Project

The program allows users to perform various conversions:

Fahrenheit to Celsius
Celsius to Fahrenheit
Miles to Kilometers
Kilometers to Miles

Each conversion is implemented as a separate object, with a dedicated specification and implementation file for each class. The program utilizes class constructors to initialize conversion variables and adheres to good programming practices.
